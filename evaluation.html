                        <h3>User Experience</h3>
                        <p>During the development of this project, we based our decision-making upon what users of our
                            library are looking for.</p>
                        <p>On the learner side, we focus on producing interpretable and insightful visualizations to
                            track and guide their learning journey.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We studied research papers (“What Learning Visualisations to Offer Students” by Susan
                                Bull and “Individual and Peer Comparison Open Learner Model Visualisations to Identify
                                What to Work On Next” by Susan Bull) on effective visualisations that students find the
                                most helpful and understandable and finalised on nine different types of visualisations:
                                Bar Charts, Line Charts, Dot Plots, Pie Charts, Rose Charts, Bubble Charts, Tree Maps,
                                Radar Charts and Word Clouds. These visualisations inform users on their skill level
                                across different subjects, the level of certainty of our prediction as well as how this
                                has developed over time.
                            </li>
                            <li>We used a universal colour-scale “Greens” (which is a shade rather than several
                                different colours) due to feedback from our client that this is this is an easily
                                understandable way, to depict the skill level of users and its certainty level.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>On the developer side, we focused on adhering to design principles mentioned in our
                            literature review, such as "Consistency", “Inspections” and “Sensible Defaults.”</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Consistency</b>: All the classifiers in truelearn library has the same and consistent
                                interface. For training, all the classifiers have <code>fit</code> method, and for
                                prediction, all the classifiers have <code>predict</code> and <code>predict_proba</code>
                                function.</li>
                            <li><b>Inspection</b>: All the classes in <code>truelearn.models</code> and
                                <code>truelearn.learning</code> are inspectable, which means developers can inspect the
                                internal states of these classes via either getter/setter or exposed
                                <code>@property</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Sensible Defaults</b>: Parameters are key parts of all the classifiers. To reduce the
                                time cost of researching on different parameters for users, we provide an appropriate
                                default value to each parameter. The default value is not necessarily the best in a
                                custom use case but provides sensible results in general. Based on our evaluation of the
                                default values chosen in our tests, it is reasonable to say that our classifier has
                                sensible default values.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Overall, we would say we did <b>Very Good</b> in this aspect.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Functionality</h3>
                        <p>We have always focused on the key design target, which is about modelling learners'
                            knowledge, predicting their engagement with educational resources and providing insightful
                            visualisations to help learners reflect on their study. We delivered 100% (36 out of 36) of
                            the key functionalities we intended to deliver and 50% (3 out of 6) of the optional
                            functionalities on our MoSCoW list. Without diving too deep, these include but not limited
                            to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Build a model of a learner's knowledge from their learning history</li>
                            <li>Predict learners' engagement based on their past learning events</li>
                            <li>Create various kinds of visualizations that highlight changes in users' knowledge over
                                time and users' understanding of different knowledge</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Overall, we would say we did <b>Very Good</b> in this aspect.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Stability</h3>
                        <p>Throughout the development process, we followed an intensive testing procedure. We achieved
                            100% on code coverage of core functionalities of truelearn library (models, learning,
                            datasets, preprocessing, utils.metrics). We also deploy a list of linters that statically
                            analyse our codebase based on different perspectives (code quality, code style,
                            documentation style, security, type checking). All of these are checked on every commit by
                            using CI/CD.</p>
                        <p>Overall, we would say we did <b>Good</b> in this aspect.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                        <p>Throughout our development process, we continuously looked for ways to do optimizations and
                            do timing profiling by using <code>hyperfine</code> to study how our refactoring affects the
                            wall clock
                            running time of our application. As stated in the “Testing/Performance Testing” section, we
                            improved the running time of the <code>NoveltyClassifier</code> by about 20%, significantly
                            reduced the
                            number of memory allocations (by more 50%) and slightly decreased the overall memory
                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>Overall, we would say we did <b>Very Good</b> in this aspect.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Compatibility</h3>
                        <p>Building on top of Python, our library is naturally compatible with different operating
                            systems (OSX, Linux, Windows). In terms of Python version support, we choose to support any
                            Python version between 3.7 (the earliest version that has not ended its lifecycle yet) and
                            3.11(the latest release). To ensure that these compatibility guarantees were not broken, we
                            deploy ci checks on these 3 operating systems and these 5 Python versions, which is 3*5=15
                            checks in total. </p>
                        <p>For dependencies, we choose them carefully by considering their API stability, minimal Python
                            version support (which must be Python 3.7+), and license (which must be a permissive
                            license). This allows us to balance functionality support with our compatibility guarantees
                            and licensing option (MIT license).</p>

                        <h3>Maintainability</h3>
                        <p>Another key aspect we prioritised was maintainability.</p>
                        <p>We made sure that any future development would be seamless process by including comprehensive
                            type annotations, explanations and examples for every method and class in our documentation.
                            We also provide contributors with detailed guidelines on how to set up a Truelearn
                            development environment, design new components, create new tests and submit PRs.</p>
                        <p>In terms of codebase, we utilised multiple design patterns to make sure our code is easily
                            extensible and loosely coupled. Each public method and class are tested thoroughly by using
                            doc tests and unit tests. At the same time, we established a consistent code style in the
                            codebase based on PEP8, Google Python Style Guide, and Black Code Style, and implemented
                            strict ci checks (prospector-pydocstyle, typos, black), which further reduced maintenance
                            costs.</p>
                        <p>Overall, we would say we did <b>Very Good</b> in this aspect.</p>

                        <h3>Project management</h3>
                        <p>The team worked well together. Throughout the 15 weeks, we made sure to produce a to-do list
                            on a weekly basis. Each task was assigned to team members alongside a deadline. We stuck to
                            our deadlines well. We organised weekly meetings with our clients and ourselves outside of
                            labs. Some meetings were cancelled due to train strikes or if it were not needed. Every
                            member played their part to ensure the success of the project.</p>

                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Explore real-world application</b>: we intend to bring the exciting functionalities and
                            visualisations of truelearn library to x5Learn, an open-education platform. In terms of
                            data, x5learn has divided all videos into 5-minute segments, extracted the Wikipedia topics
                            within each segment and was able to record user engagement through their algorithm. Thus, to
                            integrate TrueLearn into their platform, we only need to study how to integrate our model
                            into their backend API and database and embed visualisations into their React-based WebApp.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Extend Classifiers</b>: currently, the developers can only run a simple
                            version of TrueLearn experiments by using our library. To allow them to easily replicate the
                            entire TrueLearn experiment, we can add supports for classifiers that are based on knowledge
                            tracing and methods that can perform hyperparameter training.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Improve Documentation</b>: we can improve the user experience of our documentation by
                            introducing interactive code snippets that allow users to execute examples in our
                            documentation in their browsers. To achieve this, we need to research on WASM, which allows
                            us to run Python in browser.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Explore Semantic Information</b>: currently, classifiers in truelearn library does not
                            utilize any information between different knowledge components. For example, machine
                            learning and linear regression are treated as different unrelated topics (but there are
                            connections between them). In theory, the relationships between different topics give us
                            more information about the learner and can therefore, boost the performance (accuracy,
                            precision, recall, and f1) of the truelearn classifiers. These semantic relationships also
                            allow us to design new visualisations. For example, we can group related topics into
                            categories and create category-based visualisations. To achieve this, we need to integrate
                            semantic TrueLearn https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10141501/ into our library, which
                            entails extending the current model sub-package (storing Semantic Relatedness (SR)
                            annotations) and implementing the semantics algorithm logic in the learning
                            sub-package.
